# Azure Lab setup

Welcome to the striking world of cloud computing! This is the first task in the module, and it's purpose is to make sure that you prepared required infrastructure and to get used to the format of tasks. 

Tasks in this module are relying on 2 Powershell scripts: 

- `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` generates the "artifacs", and uploads them to the cloud storage. "Artifact" is an evidence of task, completed by you. Each task will have it's own script, which will gather artifacts, required in task. Script also adds a link to the generated artifact the file `artifacts.json` in this repository - make sure to commit changes to this file after you run the script. 
- `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1` validates the artifacts, generated by the first script. It loads information about the task artifacts from the file `artifacts.json`.  

## Task

### Prerequisites

Before completing any task in the module, make sure that you followed all the steps, described in the "Environment setup" topic, in particular: 

1. Make sure you have an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) account and subscription
2. In the Azure subscription, create a resource group, called "mate-academy"
3. In the "mate-academy" resource group, create a storage account (any name), and a container "task-artifacts"
4. Install [Powershell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4) on your computer. All tasks in this module use Powershell 7, to run it in the terminal, run the following command: 
```
    pwsh
```
5. Install [Azure module for Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-11.3.0) for Powershell 7: 
```
Install-Module -Name Az -Repository PSGallery -Force
```
If you are a Windows user, before running this command, please also run: 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
6. Log in to your Azure account using Powershell:
```
    Connect-AzAccount -TenantId <your Microsoft Entra ID tenant id>
```

### Requirements

In this task, you need to perform the following steps: 

1. Start Powershell 7, and run the script for generating artifacts: 
```
    scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1
``` 
Script will promt you only for 1 parameter - name of the storage account you created when completing the pre-requirements. 

2. If you want to test your solution before submitting it - run script for artifacts validation: 
```
    scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1
```
Script should run without errors. 

3. Commit your changes, and submit your solution for a review.
